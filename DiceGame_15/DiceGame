There are two given cases:
 *1
 We recieve the dollar sum comparable to the result of two dices.
 Let consider the max situation, that is the sum to be 12(6+6).
 This is the highest we could get in this game.
 
 *2
 We recieve the dollar sum equal to the square of the resultant number.
 Let's consider the max situation, that is the number to be 6, hence the sum to be 36.\
 This is the highest we could get in this game.
 
If we compare the above two cases, then it looks like the case 2 has more probable profit than the case 1.
