# LOOK Algorithm Theory

Look Algorithm is a disk scheduling algorithm used to schedule the Input/Output requests that arrive at the disk.
It is considered among the most efficient algorithms for disc scheduling.

Working:
  The head moves from the given position to the last input/output request in the given direction and from the last
  request, it turns back and moves to the opposite end last reques and then repeats the same as above. 
  While this movement it completes the tasks in the order it finds them.
