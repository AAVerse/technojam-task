# LOOK Algorithm Theory

Look Algorithm is a disk scheduling algorithm used to schedule the Input/Output requests that arrive at the disk.
It is considered among the most efficient algorithms for disc scheduling.

Working:
  The head moves from the given position to the last input/output request in the given direction and from the last
  request, it turns back and moves to the opposite end last reques and then repeats the same as above. 
  While this movement it completes the tasks in the order it finds them.
  
Advantages:
  If there are no requests left to be services the Head will not move to the end of the disk unlike SCAN algorithm.
  Better performance is provided compared to SCAN Algorithm.
  Starvation is avoided in LOOK scheduling algorithm.
  Low variance is provided in waiting time and response time.
  
Disadvantages:
  Overhead of finding the end requests is present.
  Cylinders which are just visited by Head have to wait for long time.

Example:
            _________________________________________________________________________________  
            0     14      41      53      65      67      98      122     124     183     199
                                   *
                                           *
                                                  *     
                                                          * 
                                                                   *
                                                                           *
                                                                                   *
                                                                                   
                           *
                   *
                   
                   
            In this the head starts at 53 and goes til 183 which is the last process(In SCAN algorithm,
            it would go till 199). After reaching 183 it turns at goes till 14.
